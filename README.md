# LinkedIn landing page clone 💥

This project is a clone of the LinkedIn landing page built using Django. It aims to mimic the look
and feel of LinkedIn's homepage, providing a platform to practise and showcase my web development skills 😁.

**Please note that this project was completed around the 1st July 2024. There may be changes to LinkedIn's
current user interface.**
